# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

### get api credential from

[openweather](https://home.openweathermap.org/)

A sample data from api call looks like:

```json
{"coord":{"lon":-0.13,"lat":51.51},"weather":[{"id":300,"main":"Drizzle","description":"light intensity drizzle","icon":"09d"}],"base":"stations","main":{"temp":280.32,"pressure":1012,"humidity":81,"temp_min":279.15,"temp_max":281.15},"visibility":10000,"wind":{"speed":4.1,"deg":80},"clouds":{"all":90},"dt":1485789600,"sys":{"type":1,"id":5091,"message":0.0103,"country":"GB","sunrise":1485762037,"sunset":1485794875},"id":2643743,"name":"London","cod":200}
```

## Instructions

This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras

If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
